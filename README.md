# Messenger

> **Abstract** : This project presents a basic chat application using Python's socket programming and multi-threading capabilities, integrated with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter. The system consists of two components: a server and a client, each running on separate threads to ensure real-time communication without freezing the GUI.

The server listens for incoming messages on a designated port and can also send messages to the client. Similarly, the client listens for server messages and allows user input to be transmitted. Communication is achieved using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which provides a connectionless, low-latency message transmission between the two ends.

Key features include:
- A user-friendly GUI with message display and input fields.
- Bidirectional communication using UDP sockets.
- Concurrent message sending and receiving enabled by Python threads.
- Graceful application exit and socket closure to avoid resource leaks.

This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of networking, multithreading, and GUI design, serving as a foundational step toward more complex real-time communication systems like chat apps or multiplayer games.
